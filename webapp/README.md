cd webapp
npm install
npm start
```

The app will open at http://localhost:3000

## Build

To build the webapp for production:

```bash
cd webapp
npm run build
```

## Data Structure

The webapp expects data to be available at `./data/` with the following structure:

```
data/
├── index.json              # App index generated by generate_webapp_data.py
├── AppName1/
│   ├── manifest.json       # App metadata
│   ├── icon.png           # App icon (if available)
│   ├── info.plist         # Info.plist data
│   ├── entitlements.plist # App entitlements
│   ├── sandbox.txt        # Sandbox analysis
│   └── sdef/              # SDEF files directory
│       └── *.sdef
└── AppName2/
    └── ...
```

## Deployment

The webapp is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when:
1. Changes are made to the `data/` directory
2. Changes are made to the `webapp/` directory  
3. The deployment workflow is manually triggered

The deployment is handled by `.github/workflows/deploy-webapp.yml`.
